# robot1: Robotic Weeder

## Project Overview
This repository contains the development of **robot1**, an autonomous robotic weeder designed to identify and remove weeds using a mechanical arm for pinching. The system integrates hardware for mobility and manipulation with software for vision-based detection and control.

### Key Features (Planned)
- Mechanical weed removal via a pinching arm.
- Differential drive system with two rear-driven wheels and two front caster wheels.
- Vision system for weed detection using USB camera and OpenMV.
- AI integration via LLM for advanced decision-making.
- Power-efficient design suitable for field operations.

### Development Status
- Early stage: Initial planning and component selection.
- Environment: Developed using GitHub Codespaces on a Mac Mini.

### Quick Start
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/blairmc/robot1.git`.
2. Open in GitHub Codespaces for seamless development.
3. Refer to `docs/setup.md` for detailed setup instructions.
